 * of the network it uses, so that the request goes out over the mobile data

/**
 * Lets the cash service use the connection the device already has.
 *
 * The cash service of the operator is tied to the mobile data connection of
 * the line: the operator checks that a transaction comes from the mobile
 * network of the line, and the application makes it so by putting the cash
 * network manager on the mobile data connection before every request. When the
 * mobile data is off, the application shows the message that the mobile data
 * has to be turned on, and the cash service cannot be reached.
 *
 * The patch leaves the network as it is, so the cash requests go out over the
 * connection the device is already using. Whether the operator answers them is
 * the operator's own decision, and this patch does not change what the
 * operator answers.
 *
 * Nothing else about the cash service changes: the same requests are made and
 * the same answers are shown.
