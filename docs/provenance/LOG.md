# Provenance log

Every derived fact about a target application is recorded here, together with how
it was obtained. The point is that a reviewer can retrace the work without
assuming anything was carried over from another project.

## Environment record

| Date | Item | Value |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-04 | Stock build used | `com.anghami` 8.0.28, version code 8000280 |
| 2026-11-04 | Build container | APKM bundle, universal variant, seven DEX files in the base APK |
| 2026-11-04 | Minimum SDK declared by the build | 23 |
| 2026-11-04 | Signing certificate subject | `O=Anghami, C=LB` |
| 2026-11-04 | Signing certificate SHA-256 | `5e5d1b3609403e1db445d142ef36433a2ad2008030281d437d9e632c01c45659` |

## Derivation records

| Date | Behaviour | Consulted | Derived | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-04 | platform metadata | stock APKM `info.json` and `META-INF/BNDLTOOL.RSA` | package name, version name, version code, minimum SDK, signing certificate digest | certificate digest recomputed from the DER certificate |

> The certificate digest above was read from the v1 JAR signature of the base
> APK. Before release it must be confirmed against the v2/v3 signing block with
> `apksigner verify --print-certs`, so that the value enforced at install time is
> the one recorded here.

## Behaviour derivations

### How the application models a subscription — mapped 2026-11-04

Every behaviour in this bundle that depends on whether the user pays reaches that
answer through the same small class, so the map is recorded once here and referred
to from the individual specs.

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Account state object | `Lcom/anghami/ghost/local/Account;`, a single instance field, handed out by `getAccountInstance()` |
| The decision that matters | `isPlusUser()Z` on that instance — true when the stored plan type is `PLUS`, or `FREE_TRIAL`, or when `isGoldUser()` is true |
| The static shorthand | `Account.isPlus()Z` — wraps `isPlusUser()` of the current instance through a compiler-generated callback object |
| Gold tier | `isGoldUser()Z` — stored plan type equals `GOLD`; `Account.isGold()Z` is its static wrapper |
| Persistence | the instance is read from an on-disk account file and written back by one write helper, so the stored plan type is a local copy of what the server sent |

**Why this matters for patch design:** changing `isPlusUser()` changes every
decision built on it at once, and there are dozens of call sites across playback,
downloads, lyrics, settings and the player. That is powerful and it is broad: a
single change would silently turn the entitlement, the badge and the lyrics gate
into one behaviour, which is exactly what this bundle avoids. The shared class is
therefore treated as a place to *read* state from, not as a shortcut to rewrite.

### `anghami.system.rating-prompt` — derived 2026-11-04

**Consulted:** the stock 8.0.28 build only, decompiled locally with apktool
3.0.3 and `--no-res`. No other patch collection was opened.

**How it was found:**

1. Listed the libraries bundled in the build and noticed the Play in-app review
   library is present.
2. Searched, across the whole application, for code that references that
   library. Two synthetic classes matched.
3. One of them logs the tag `AppRater`, which led to the package the
   application uses for rating.
4. Enumerated that package and inspected its members.

**Derived facts:**

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Rating controller | `Lcom/anghami/ghost/rating/AppRater;`, a singleton |
| Decision predicate | `getShouldShowDialog()Z` — true only when online, past a reset window, past a minimum time since first launch, past a minimum launch count, not already rated for this version, and past a minimum event count |
| Call sites of the predicate | exactly one outside the class: the rating-event handler in the main activity |
| Store-presence gate | `Lcom/anghami/util/c;->g(Landroidx/fragment/app/n;)Z`, true when the store package is installed |
| Two presentation paths | a custom dialog when the store is absent, the Play in-app review sheet when it is present |

**Decision:** change the predicate, not the dialog and not the review call. One
change then covers both presentation paths, and the dialog code and the review
library stay untouched. This also avoids depending on the two synthetic classes,
which are compiler-generated and unstable.

**Verification run:** 2026-11-04, `verifyPatches` against the stock base APK.
Result: the fingerprint matched exactly one method (`validate = true` enforces
that a fingerprint matches at most one method), and the patch applied with no
exception.

## Not consulted

No source, comment, identifier, helper or fingerprint from any other patch
collection has been used to produce anything in this repository.
